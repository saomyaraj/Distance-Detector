# This is an Ultrasound Sensor with LED project.
This is a circuit that uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect the distance of an object and then lights up an LED if the object is within a certain range.
<br>
The circuit is made using a breadboard and the components used are:
1. Arduino Uno
2. Ultrasonic Sensor
3. LED
4. Connecting Wires
<br>
The code is written in Arduino IDE and is uploaded to the Arduino Uno
